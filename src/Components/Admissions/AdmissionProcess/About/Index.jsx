              The admission process at Future Foundation Schools is simple and transparent. It works on the belief that a personal interaction between parents / authorized guardians, the prospective student and the school's authorized representatives is of far greater value than any conventional admission test. The process is aimed at giving us an insight into the type of education approach and environment you believe would be appropriate for your child to maximize his/her potential while giving us a glimpse of the child's strengths, learning needs and potential. It also gives you, as parents / authorized guardians, a first-hand opportunity to obtain an understanding of how our students and faculty engage with each other, our overall offering, curricula and our educational approach.</p>
            
            <p className="admissionpro-about-desp">
              The admission process at Future Foundation Schools begins on the 15th of December and till the 15th of January of every calendar year. Admissions are granted on a first come first served basis till seats are available.</p>
