The purpose of school should be to develop bits of intelligence and to help people reach vocational and vocational goals appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligence. People who are helped to do so, I believe, feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve society in a constructive way </p>

Each child has unique talents, interests and intelligence. Dr. Howard Gardner has presented 8 different intelligences that each one of us has in varying degrees.
